## Example Conversation Flow

**User**: "Symptoms"  
**Bot**: "📍 Symptoms of Late Blight: Water-soaked lesions, White mold, Brown areas. Typically on lower leaves in humid conditions."

**User**: "How treat"  
**Bot**: "💊 Treatment: Copper sulfate (0.5-1%), Mancozeb (2g/L), Chlorothalonil. Apply every 7-10 days during wet season."

**User**: "Organic"  
**Bot**: "🌱 Organic options: Bacillus subtilis, Trichoderma harzianum, Pseudomonas fluorescens. Natural but slower than chemicals."

**User**: "Cost"  
**Bot**: "💰 Fungicides: Low to Medium cost. Biological: Medium to High. Consider both effectiveness and budget."

**User**: "Prevent"  
**Bot**: "🛡️ Prevention: Use resistant varieties • Avoid overhead irrigation. Best during Spring to early fall."

## Pro Tips

1. **Users don't need perfect grammar** - Bot understands intent
2. **Short is better** - "Treat" works as well as "How do I treat this"
3. **Typos are OK** - Bot uses fuzzy matching
4. **Multiple words work** - "How to prevent" understood same as "prevent"
5. **Emoji responses are visual cues** - Help users scan answers quickly
6. **Bot provides comprehensive info** - Even short queries get detailed answers

## Troubleshooting

**If bot doesn't understand:**

1. Check if it's a recognized keyword (see table above)
2. Try simpler words (e.g., "treat" instead of "treatment")
3. Try different keywords (e.g., "organic" instead of "biological")
4. Ask a different way (e.g., "prevent" instead of "how avoid")
5. Provide more context if completely unclear

**If response seems incomplete:**

- Bot is designed to be concise for mobile
- Ask a follow-up question for more details
- Use "more" or specific keywords to get more info
